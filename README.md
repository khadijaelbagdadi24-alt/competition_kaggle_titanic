# competition_kaggle_titanic

I worked on this project to predict Titanic survivors. It was a great way to learn how to use machine learning for classification.

### How I did it:
* **Cleaning**: I filled the missing values for Age and Fare using the median.
* **Features**: I used Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, and Embarked.
* **Encoding**: I changed 'Sex' into 0 and 1 and used dummies for 'Embarked'.
* **Model**: I used a Random Forest Classifier with 100 estimators.

### Results:
My final score on Kaggle is **0.78468**.
